## Cookbook - tips and tricks for `cuic`

`cuic` is rather low-level library containing only primitives that can
be used as building blocks for more complex use cases. The following 
articles contain some snippets for the different real-life use cases 
I've encountered and how I've solved them with `cuic` so far.

Note that these snippets are not the only or the "right" way to solve
these use cases, but rather examples that you can use as a base for 
your own solutions!
